1. Sum of Digits of a Number

Algorithm:

1. Start
2. Prompt the user to enter a number
3. Initialize sum to 0
4. While the number is greater than 0
5. Get the last digit of the number (number % 10)
6. Add the last digit to sum
7. Remove the last digit from the number (number / 10)
8. Print the sum
9. End

Pseudocode:

START
   PRINT "Enter a number: "
   READ number
   SET sum = 0
   WHILE number > 0
      SET digit = number % 10
      SET sum = sum + digit
      SET number = number 
   END WHILE
   PRINT "Sum of digits: ", sum
END

2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle, Square, and Circle

Algorithm:

1. Start
2. For Rectangle:
	Prompt the user to enter the length and width
	Calculate the area as length * width
	Print the area
3. For Square:
	Prompt the user to enter the side length
	Calculate the area as side * side
	Print the area
4. For Circle:
	Prompt the user to enter the radius
	Calculate the area as Ï€ * radius * radius
	Print the area
5. End

Pseudocode:

START
   Rectangle
   PRINT "Enter the length of the rectangle: "
   READ length
   PRINT "Enter the width of the rectangle: "
   READ width
   SET area_rectangle = length * width
   PRINT "Area of rectangle: ", area_rectangle
   
   Square
   PRINT "Enter the side length of the square: "
   READ side
   SET area_square = side * side
   PRINT "Area of square: ", area_square
   
   Circle
   PRINT "Enter the radius of the circle: "
   READ radius
   SET area_circle = 3.14 * radius * radius
   PRINT "Area of circle: ", area_circle
END

3. Calculate the Average of 5 Marks

Algorithm:

1. Start
2. Prompt the user to enter 5 marks
3. Calculate the sum of the marks
4. Calculate the average as sum / 5
5. If average >= 75 and <= 90, print "Excellent"
	Else if average >= 60 and < 75, print "Good"
	Else if average >= 45 and < 60, print "Pass"
	Else, print "Fail"
6. End

Pseudocode:

START
   PRINT "Enter mark 1: "
   READ mark1
   PRINT "Enter mark 2: "
   READ mark2
   PRINT "Enter mark 3: "
   READ mark3
   PRINT "Enter mark 4: "
   READ mark4
   PRINT "Enter mark 5: "
   READ mark5
   
   SET sum = mark1 + mark2 + mark3 + mark4 + mark5
   SET average = sum / 5
   
   IF average >= 75 AND average <= 90 THEN
      PRINT "Excellent"
   ELSE IF average >= 60 AND average < 75 THEN
      PRINT "Good"
   ELSE IF average >= 45 AND average < 60 THEN
      PRINT "Pass"
   ELSE
      PRINT "Fail"
   END IF
END
