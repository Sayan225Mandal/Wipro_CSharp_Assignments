1. Significance of Scope of the Variable and Different Scope Options in C#
Significance of Scope of the Variable:

Scope refers to the visibility and lifetime of a variable within a program.
Visibility: Determines where the variable can be accessed or modified.
Lifetime: Determines how long the variable exists in memory.
Properly managing scope ensures variables are accessible where needed and prevents accidental modification or misuse.

Different Scope Options in C#:

Local Scope: Variables declared inside a method or block. Accessible only within that method or block.

Parameter Scope: Variables declared as parameters in a method signature. Accessible only within that method.

Class-Level (Instance) Scope: Variables declared inside a class but outside any method. Accessible by all methods within the class.

Static Scope: Variables declared with the static keyword inside a class. Accessible by all methods within the class and shared among all instances of the class.

Namespace Scope: Variables declared outside any class, struct, or method, within a namespace. Not common practice, but accessible throughout the namespace.

2. Difference between a Variable and a Constant
Variable:

A storage location identified by a memory address and a symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
The value of a variable can change during program execution.

Constant:

A value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution. It remains the same throughout the lifetime of the program.
Declared using the const keyword in C#.

3. Maximum Value that can be Stored in an Integer Variable in C#
In C#, the int type is a 32-bit signed integer.
The maximum value it can hold is 2,147,483,647.
This can be represented using the int.MaxValue constant.
